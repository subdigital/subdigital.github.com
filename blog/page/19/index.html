  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000989.html" target="_blank">Jeff Atwood</a> takes a stand against using embedded languages to express intent.I concur with <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/10/31/Embracing-fluent-interfaces.aspx" target="_blank">Ayende&#8217;s response</a> for most of his points, however I wanted to chime in on the discussion.</p>


<p>Later on, Jeff argues that a better way (or as he puts it, the <b>&#8220;ultimate solution&#8221;</b>) is to include the underlying features of other languages to leverage them natively.He specifically mentions LINQ.Take a look at this sample LINQ syntax:</p>


<p></p>


<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>var priorityCustomers = from customer in Customers&lt;br>            where customer.Status = 'Gold'&lt;br>           select customer;</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>


<p></p>


<p>This syntax is great, and I welcome it for VS 2008.But this is almost the same thing as the Criteria API in NHibernate, or the Querying API in SubSonic.The only difference is that we&#8217;re not using parentheses and dots all over the place, but the end result is the same.</p>


<p>Having this code directly in our language also makes it more difficult to construct dynamic queries.By dynamic I don&#8217;t mean make the <em>&#8216;Gold&#8217;</em> text a parameter, I&#8217;m talking about building the where clause dynamically based on run-time decisions.Using a query builder API such as SubSonic&#8217;s allows you to do this.</p>


<p>Another point that Atwood makes is that creating fluent interfaces over things like regexes and SQL allows you to NOT learn the underlying concepts, which is unacceptable for professional developers.I agree with him, but LINQ is also one of those!The syntax we wrote above will get translated into a real T-SQL query for us.We should still be cognizant of the SQL that is generated and make adjustments where necessary, but does that mean we always have to program at the lowest common denominator?As professional developers we have to be aware of many technical concepts that are being abstracted from us.A lot of us program in .NET, and most of us probably have a background in C++.I&#8217;m glad I learned C++ so that I understand what&#8217;s going on &#8220;behind the curtain,&#8221; but I&#8217;m programming at a higher level of abstraction now.Remember having to always null-terminate your strings (I mean char arrays)?.I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t have to do that anymore.Working at a higher level of abstraction allows me to be more productive.</p>


<p>The languages that we see in the coming years will almost certainly bost higher layers of abstraction and specialty, so that we can more easily build data-driven business applications, or 3D-modeled geology simulations, or whatever your domain is.AT&amp;T has <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2007/10/att-invents-pro.html" target="_blank">just created a programming language called Hancock</a>, specifically geared for mass surveylance.ERLang is designed specifically for mission-critical, always-on systems.&nbsp; There are many that exist today and even more that we haven&#8217;t seen yet.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t fear the abstractions!<br></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something about <a href="http://www.ayende.com/blog">Ayende</a> inspires me to build something.&nbsp; I got to thinking today about how I could create a DSL for NHibernate mapping files.&nbsp; What&#8217;s wrong with XML, you say?&nbsp; Well&#8230;<br><br><ul><li><b>It&#8217;s verbose</b> - XML is known for it&#8217;s ability to easily validate based on a schema, not for readability.&nbsp; In other words, XML was designed for computers, not humans.&nbsp; Since I am a human (are you?) I would prefer something a bit more friendly.</li><li><b>Schema Validation takes time</b> - Usually you don&#8217;t notice, but <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/10/26/Real-World-NHibernate-Reducing-startup-times-for-large-amount-of.aspx">some recent metrics show</a> that it can account for more than 1/2 of the startup time for NHibernate when there are many mapping files.&nbsp; If you have an appliaction with 1000 entities, arguably you have bigger problems than XML&#8217;s readability and schema validation performance, but it IS noticable so hey&#8230;.</li><li><b>Generates runtimes errors for semantic structure - </b>Sure, the syntax is validated, but there are so many things that can go wrong with runtime compilation (that&#8217;s a weird term) of mappings.</li></ul>So I got to thinking how we could do better.&nbsp; Here&#8217;s what I came up with (with some additions from Ayende) &#8211; it&#8217;s in Boo:<br><br></p>

<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>import flux88.NHibernate.Mapping&lt;br>&lt;br>mapping Test.Project, Test.Project.Entities&lt;br>&lt;br> entity Customer,&lt;br>  table: Customers&lt;br> default_access: "nosetter.camelcase-underscore"entity Customer, &lt;br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identity "Id", &lt;br>      generator: "native"&lt;br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; property Name,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;br>     column:&nbsp;&nbsp; "CustomerName",&lt;br>  type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "String(12)", &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;br>    nullable: false&lt;br>&lt;br>  property DateJoined,&lt;br>&lt;br>  property Address,&lt;br>     type: "String(200)"&lt;br>&lt;br>  set _orders,&lt;br>  access: "field",&lt;br>     manyToMany Order,&lt;br>       table: Orders,&lt;br>       pk_column: "customer_id",&lt;br>        fk_column: "order_id",&lt;br>       inverse: true&lt;br>     &lt;br> entity Order,&lt;br>   table: Orders&lt;br>&lt;br></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>


<p>Note that there isn&#8217;t a ton of extra fluff, it&#8217;s meant to be light-weight and easy to write.&nbsp; Additionally you could set defaults at the top (like default_access) so that you can avoid typing it all over your mappings.</p>


<p>Ayende added the notion of doing this:</p>


<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>for type in assembly.GetTypes():&lt;br> continue if type.Namespace != "My.Model"&lt;br> entity type.Name, type.Namespace:&lt;br> idenity "id"&lt;br> &lt;br>for prop in type.GetProperties():&lt;br>property prop.Name&lt;br>&lt;br></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>


<p>You get the idea.</p>


<p>There could be a number of benefits of doing it like this.&nbsp; First, you can compile it, so you can get syntax errors notified.&nbsp; If you use the BooExplorer I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;d get intellisense for this.&nbsp; I could also see plugging this into a model validator that would reflect over the model and make sure that all of the properties and access strategies will work with the mapping as defined.</p>


<p>Anyway, I have some reading up on DSL&#8217;s to do&#8230; Ayende, that means I need you to <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/10/12/Book-Idea-Writing-Domain-Specific-Languages-in-Boo.aspx">write that book on DSLs with Boo</a> :)&nbsp; Can I have it next week?<br></p>


<p>Thoughts?&nbsp; Suggestions?<br><p></p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of buzz is going around about the MVC framework coming out of Microsoft.&nbsp; I posted about how cool it was and got a couple of comments that basically said:&nbsp;</p>


<blockquote>They just copied MonoRail.</blockquote>


<p>Well, yes.&nbsp; In a sense they did.&nbsp; And Rails.&nbsp; And Django.&nbsp; And another one that The Gu mentioned that I hadn&rsquo;t heard of.&nbsp; Is that a bad thing?&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re using MonoRail today, then you should continue to use it.&nbsp; Unless you like some of the different syntax or ability to mock the core ASP.NET Runtime objects.</p>


<p>The reason I think that ASP.NET MVC is so exciting and important is because I often come to clients that refuse to (or make it very difficult) to use non-MSFT produced thingies.&nbsp; Can I use Resharper?&nbsp; No, we gave you Visual Studio.&nbsp; Can I use NHibernate?&nbsp; No we use Enterprise Library.&nbsp; Can I use&nbsp;NAnt, StructureMap, MonoRail, SubSonic?&nbsp; Often times the answer is no.&nbsp; Recently I&rsquo;ve had experience where our team dumped eWorldUI in favor of ASP.NET Ajax Control Toolkit.&nbsp; The reason?&nbsp; Easier to get approved since it has Microsoft&rsquo;s name attached to it.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter that eWorldUI is free and easy to implement.&nbsp; It matters because somebody sees eworldui.dll in a bin folder somewhere and everyone wants to know where it came from.</p>


<p>When you work in an organization with 10,000 employees that has widely adopted Microsoft as a technology platform, trying to get something approved like MonoRail is <strong>like trying to convince a Catholic priest that he&rsquo;s really a Mormon</strong>.&nbsp; <em>Ok so that doesn&rsquo;t really make much sense, but what I&rsquo;m getting across is that <strong>it&rsquo;s hard.</strong></em></p>


<p>Some of my readers have already gone down this route, and succeeded.&nbsp; And I commend you.&nbsp; But I have yet to get corporate adoption of something like that.&nbsp; Maybe it&rsquo;s my inability to convince people of the benefits, or sway their concerns about supportability and such.&nbsp; Or maybe I just work with very beligerant clients.&nbsp; </p>


<p><em>Some of my colleagues probably read this blog, so just so you know I&rsquo;m not talking about you&hellip; I&rsquo;m talking about <strong>the other guy</strong>. <img src="/images/smile3__.gif"   />.</em></p>


<p>Back to my original argument.&nbsp; Since this is a new framework coming out of Microsoft, I will not have to fight to get it adopted.&nbsp; I can go in and say &ldquo;this is how it&rsquo;s done for <em>real</em> applications&rdquo; and have Microsoft guidance to back me up.&nbsp; Hell, some clients might even ask me for it!&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll be interesting.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t imagine what it would be like for a client to come up to me and say &ldquo;hey I was thinking, maybe we should use NHibernate for this&hellip;&rdquo;</p>


<p>Thinking about that makes me kind of sad that it <em>hasn&rsquo;t </em>happened before.&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I just unlucky?&nbsp; Am I just not skilled at convincing?&nbsp; Or is this commonplace in the industry?</p>


<p><strong>System.Web.MVC will reach an audience that MonoRail doesn&rsquo;t:&nbsp; The corporate giant who already swallowed the pill and will do anything that Microsoft pushes, good or bad</strong>.&nbsp; And a&nbsp;lot of consultants work firmly in this space.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><font>The collective jaws were dropped at ALT.NET.&nbsp; Just about everyone attended this talk by Scott Guthrie.&nbsp; If you’d like to watch this, Scott Hanselman has recorded the video and posted on his blog.</font></p>


<p><font><img src="/images/ScottGu_2DMVC_small_.jpg" alt="ScottGu-MVC"  border="0" /></font></p>


<p><font>Rather than regurgitate it all here, I’ll quickly summarize what it’s like.</font></p>


<p><font>Remember HTML?&nbsp; Yeah, that.&nbsp; We are going back to our roots and back to the model that the web really lives in, not a psuedo, event-driven state-based model that is ASP.NET Web Forms.</font></p>


<p><font>Why don’t we like ASP.NET Web Forms?&nbsp; I do like it, but it does have it’s problems.&nbsp; The benefits of ASP.NET often cause other concerns to rise up.&nbsp; Tired up re-populating data on the form?&nbsp; Here’s some Viewstate for you.&nbsp; Of course Viewstate causes page sizes to explode because most people just leave it on, even for read-only pages with no post-backs.&nbsp; Think of a grid that you place on a page.&nbsp; If you don’t have to postback to the same page again (like with a command field or something) then you can turn viewstate off and have a savings of almost 2X!&nbsp; I for one think that ViewState <em>can</em> be awesome, but it is more likely abused than leveraged.&nbsp; This is a pain point for many people.</font></p>


<p><font>The entire postback model, combined with the event-driven model is something that I have had to learn in-depth the hard way.&nbsp; I really don’t think any of that knowledge is really helpful at all outside of ASP.NET.&nbsp; I spent a crapload of time trying to get server controls to work in the complicated ASP.NET lifecycle, and does that knowledge transfer?&nbsp; Probably not.</font></p>


<p><font>Lastly I think that ASP.NET’s templated control syntax often requires an equal or even more lines of code than the actual HTML would take in the first place!&nbsp; Take the GridView for example.&nbsp; Sure it’s great and it lets you bind data and get columns autogenerated for you, but take a look of that list of properties.&nbsp; There is so much there that you almost need a degree in GridViews to be effective with it.</font></p>


<p><font>Microsoft has been paying attention to the community.&nbsp; We’ve been readily ditching ASP.NET Web Forms in favor or Ruby on Rails or MonoRail.</font></p>


<p><font>ScottGu presented the new MVC framework (codenamed <em>Scalene</em>) to a huge audience.&nbsp; There was a lot of trash talking (in a good way) between ScottGu and Scott Bellware.&nbsp; It’s not easy to take blundt criticism from people like ScottB, but The Gu took it incredibly well and even dished it out a bit.</font></p>


<p><font>What I really liked about ASP.NET MVC is that there isn’t that much to it.&nbsp; Here’s what you’d need to do to start using it on your project (exisitng or new):</font></p>


<ul><li><font>Add the System.Web.MVC.dll (or however it will be packaged — no installer exists yet)</font></li><li><font>Add 1 HttpHandler to handle a new extension</font></li><li><font>Add 1 HttpModule, which provides all of the routing and black magic of MVC</font></li></ul>


<p><font>Create a controller class, like this:</font></p>


<div style="background: rgb(244, 244, 244) none repeat scroll 0%; font-size: 16pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; color: black; font-family: Consolas;"><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: green;">//This example is for you, Jacob Lewallen :)</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: blue;">public</span> <span style="color: blue;">class</span> <span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">ClownsController</span> : <span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">Controller</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">{</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">ControllerAction</span>(DefaultAction = <span style="color: blue;">true</span>)]</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">public</span> <span style="color: blue;">void</span> List()</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ViewData = <span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">Clown</span>.FindAll();&nbsp; <span style="color: green;">//you write this method or use Castle ActiveRecord for example</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RenderView(<span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">&#8220;List&#8221;</span><font color="#a31515">);</font></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">public</span> <span style="color: blue;">void</span> SomethingSecret()</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green;">//this cannot be accessed by a url&nbsp;<br></span><span style="color: green;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//because it doesn&#8217;t have the attribute</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p><p style="margin: 0px;">}</p></div>

<p>Next you’ll need a view.&nbsp; You can use<font> aspx, Brail, or NVelocity as your templating language.&nbsp; That’s freaking great that you can choose.</font></p>


<p><font>Here’s a quick example of an aspx view:</font></p>


<div style="background: rgb(244, 244, 244) none repeat scroll 0%; font-size: 16pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; color: black; font-family: Consolas;"><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">h1</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span>Clowns<span style="color: blue;">&lt;/</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">h1</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">table</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">tr</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">th</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span>Name<span style="color: blue;">&lt;/</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">th</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">th</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span>Number of Balloons<span style="color: blue;">&lt;/</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">th</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">th</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span>Likes Kids?<span style="color: blue;">&lt;/</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">th</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">&lt;/</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">tr</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="background: rgb(255, 238, 98) none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">&lt;%</span> for(var c in ViewData) { <span style="background: rgb(255, 238, 98) none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">%&gt;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">&lt;</span><span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">tr</span><span style="color: blue;">&gt;</span></p><p style="margin:

<p>Notice how I <em>get</em>&nbsp;to use standard HTML constructs, use code blocks to provide view functionality &amp; data, and I don’t have to mess with postback or viewstate at all because I don’t need it.&nbsp; </p>


<p><strong>Wait, you mean we have to learn HTML again?</strong>&nbsp; D.H.H. often reminds us that the HTML is provides beautiful constraints that he is happy to work inside of.&nbsp; We don’t have any naming containers here.&nbsp; In fact, we don’t have any unnecessary id elements at all!&nbsp; If we did, they would be <em>exactly</em> what we typed here, making javascript integration a lot easier.</p>


<p>To wrap this all up, a customizable route in the Global.asax will map the following url to render this page:</p>


<p><a href="http://your_url/clowns/list">http://your_url/clowns/list</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;—&nbsp; look how clean!</p>


<p>The framework knows how that the format is <a href="http://your_url/%5Bcontroller%5D/%5Baction%5D">http://your_url/[controller]/[action]</a> and so it instantiates your ClownsController and looks for an action called List().</p>


<p>So much more to talk about, but I’ll&nbsp;be posting more details once I get my hands on it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow.&nbsp; What an awesome event.</p>


<p>I’ll skip the play-by-play, because that has been covered to death.&nbsp; Instead I’ll focus on my notes.&nbsp; There are definitely some “meaty” posts in my mind that are still storming, so expect good things to come.&nbsp; There are some good points here, but it’s a long post so I’ll be surprised if I get any comments <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif">.</p>


<h3>Being a Catalyst for Change</h3>


<p>I first attended a session on “Fostering Passion” and “Being a catalyst for change” which were grouped together.&nbsp; A lot of people showed up and <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/" target="_blank">J.P. Boodhoo</a> led us off.&nbsp; He talked about the importance of a good, healthy work attitude, and if you aren’t getting what you need from your current employer then you should really seek out something better.&nbsp; </p>


<ul><li>You need to show pain before you can start evangelizing new stuff.&nbsp; Ask people the question “How is that working for you?”&nbsp; or “What would you want to improve first…. why?”&nbsp; This gives you the context and the opening for suggesting new ideas.</li><li>Talk about problems in context with the 4 variables, this helps lead to whether something is “working” or not</li><ul><li>Time</li><li>Scope</li><li>Quality</li><li>Budget</li></ul><li>Hosting brown-bag sessions is a great way to get people excited.&nbsp; <a href="http://computerzen.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> pointed out that he found it valuable to create a “shadow government” of peers who you can individually get excited about different topics.&nbsp; Ask them to give&nbsp;a lunch &amp; learn and spread the word that way.&nbsp; Somebody called them “Hanselminions”&nbsp; —&nbsp; <em>epic</em>.</li><li>JP Boodhoo stressed that we build relationships before we offer to “fix up their processes.”&nbsp; If you come in wanting to change everything you’ll just alienate your team and ruin your credibility.</li><li>Another thing that we discussed is that newcomer’s to our community are going to be very overwhelmed…&nbsp; currently there isn’t much direction.&nbsp; We don’t want to be prescriptive, but a general “go in that direction” will definitely be helpful.</li></ul>


<h3>Advanced NHibernate</h3>


<p>The next session I attended was Advanced NHibernate Techniques, facilitated by <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palermo</a>.&nbsp; I found this to be awesome, because usually when I get to talk (or listen) to NHibernate at a user group or code camp, it’s focused on the beginner side of it.&nbsp; Everyone in the room had been using it for a while, and had some really good suggestions and valid problems with it.</p>


<ul><li>ActiveRecord vs. Persistant Ignorant?</li><ul><li>I suggested that for dead-simple models, or a team that doesn’t know DDD, that AR was a much easier path with less friction, however you do quickly hit a limit here when you want to start using more Domain Driven Design such as the Aggregate root/aggregate relationship, repository pattern…&nbsp; or if you need these to be remote… they can’t be used on the client side.&nbsp; Somebody pointed out that it is very difficult to switch from one to the other, and this makes the initial decision very hard.</li><li>Howard Dierking pointed out that “No Simple CRUD app stays that way”</li></ul><li>Database, Mapping, Code -&gt; which first?</li><ul><li>This was basically a poll question.&nbsp; Almost everybody here started with code, then database, then mapping.&nbsp; Very few people used hbm2ddl (like I do) to generate the database.&nbsp; We all agreed that generating the database needs to be abandoned once you start doing tuning and specific tweaks.&nbsp; The <a href="http://blog.eleutian.com/" target="_blank">Eleutian</a> guys (who have names, by the way… Aaron and Jacob) have a pretty hefty process that all starts with a modeling tool.&nbsp; It kind of scares me, but they seem to have it working so that they don’t have to re-work anything.&nbsp; To be truly DRY you definitely need another abstraction, however I’m not convinced that UML is it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>What if we had a Boo DSL that represented the mapping, and we could specify advanced DDD concepts there, and have it generate the code, hbm, and Database…</strong>?</li></ul><li>Issues?</li><ul><li>Aaron and Jacob have been stressing about Adaptive Queries and Read-only queries, and I need to make an effort to understand their problem.&nbsp; Originally I dismissed this as a non-issue, but that’s a cop-out.&nbsp; I want to understand what they are wanting that they aren’t getting with NHibernate.</li><li>We all seemed to agree that it’s painful that if you have a single error in your mapping file, the session factory throws an exception and just about every test in your application will fail.&nbsp; This SUCKS for pinpointing the error.&nbsp; I heard <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/howard_dierking" target="_blank">Howard</a> mention something about jitting the mapping assemblies (I guess while writing?) — I definitely need to continue this discussion with him.</li><li>Partials mappings would be pretty cool, so you could generate the mappings based on default conventions, then you could override when necessary.</li></ul></ul>


<h3>ASP.NET MVC Framework presented by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu" target="_blank">Scott Guthrie</a></h3>


<ul><li>This flippin’ rocks.&nbsp; A detailed post to follow.</li></ul>


<h3>Domain Driven Design – Facilitated by <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/" target="_blank">Dave Laribee</a> and <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/" target="_blank">Scott Bellware</a> (with a cameo from yours truly!)</h3>


<ul><li>This was pretty much review for me, but it’s always good to get refreshed.</li><li>Opening your mouth is a good way to get people to ask you another question (provided you didn’t say something completely stupid) — I kept getting asked to explain more topics here, which was flattering.</li><li>At one point I said “If you haven’t read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215" target="_blank">Evans</a> yet, go TODAY and buy his book.&nbsp; Then read it 8 times.”&nbsp; — This led people to believe that I had read it a few times.&nbsp; Nope!&nbsp; I still have 7 more to go <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif">.</li><li>A lot of discussion went around the different between responsibilities of the entities, and the responsibilities of domain services (not to be confused with application services or &lt;gasp&gt; SOA).</li></ul>


<h3>User Stories (facilitated by Scott Bellware &amp; <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/" target="_blank">Raymond Lewallen</a>)</h3>


<ul><li>The more I dig into this stuff the more I like it</li><li>Epics– 30,000 ft view (almost impossible to estimate) (if you have to, also provide a low confidence value)</li><li>Theme – closer, but not enough to estimate.&nbsp; Gives more detail.&nbsp; Many themes per epic</li><li>Story – small enough to provide estimate &amp; acceptance criteria.</li><li>Ray said “I can give you a gantt chart &amp; have it say whatever you want on it.”&nbsp; — this is funny, but SO true</li><li>Estimation accuracy and Trust are increased as time goes on… providing you aren’t making empty promises early on</li><li><strong>Don’t estimate a user story until you have acceptance criteria</strong></li><li>Acceptance Criteria (AC) can be technical</li><li>AC helps define “done”</li><li>Early stories will add a LOT of new concepts</li><ul><li>new models</li><ul><li>tables, entities, whatever</li></ul><li>some UI req’s</li></ul><li>Estimating epics helps w/ product planning&nbsp; (“How much can we put in by next year?”)</li><li>Release planning should NOT include epics.&nbsp; Break them down.</li><li>AC transitions, which leads is implemented in TDD/BDD style</li><li>Test names should describe the behavior, not impl.&nbsp;
I’ve got to follow this rule more often.&nbsp; A lot of tests I write are explicit in that I know what happened if it failed, but the actual story that I’m working on is missing.&nbsp; The failing test has no context, and thus no value associated with it.</li><li>BDD classes are named after the state or original behavior.&nbsp; The setups for this class put the object in that state.</li><li>Method names are named like the AC</li><ul><li>public class When_a_case_is_opened</li><ul><li>public void Its_status_is_changed_to_open</li></ul></ul></ul>


<h3>Are Executable Requirements Possible?</h3>


<ul><li><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/" target="_blank">Jeremy Miller</a> started off by stating the value of Fit vs. FitNesse and a lot of people showed pain with FitNesse.&nbsp;</li><li>Fit/FitNesse works great when dealing with state-based testing</li><li>Behavior based testing is where it breaks down and becomes really cumbersome</li><li>He invited <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo" target="_blank">Joe Ocampo</a> (from <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Los Techies</a>) to talk about NBehave</li><li>NBehave solves their problem of providing change tracking and traceability into their organization because they have a strict environment that requires it.</li><li>They have a fluent language that looks like theUserStory.AsA(“Premier Member”).IWantTo(“get a discount on future purchases”).SoThat(“I can save money”)</li><li>I joked that they could also have another fluent interface that looked like SystemShall.(“Have a textbox”).ThatShallContain(“the user’s name”)&nbsp;</li><li>This helps solve the issue where refactoring is difficult.&nbsp; Since the strings above are keys for delegate hashes, you’ll get an exception if someone changes the text of a story.&nbsp; This will spark a much needed conversation with the developers.</li></ul>


<p>I’m still trying to bask in the awesomeness that came from this event.&nbsp; All you naysayers out there are just upset that you missed out <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif">.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://subsonicproject.com">SubSonic</a>, a dead-simple code-generator / ActiveRecord ORM tool, is about to release a kick-ass new feature.&nbsp; Migrations are an awesome tool that exists in Rails, but we haven&#8217;t had a solid .NET equivalent yet.&nbsp; I hope that SubSonic Migrations will live up to the hype.<br><br>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.flux88.com/DatabaseMigrationsForNET.aspx">blogged about the need for this before</a>.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been wanting to use VSTS DB Pro in this way, but the tool just isn&#8217;t meant to provide evolutionary db support.<br><br>My current project relies on SubSonic for the code-generation, but our database development is done through DB Pro.&nbsp; I think this is a great tool, but I fear that it&#8217;s really missing something.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure the next version will be much better, as is generally true with Microsoft products.&nbsp; 1st versions often take some time to meld, get some good feedback from the general public, and get the usage stories streamlined.<br><br>I may be able to take advantage of Migrations, however the DB Project needs to contain all scripts (and they have to be named according to the client&#8217;s standards).&nbsp; I wonder if I could create the migrations, execute them, then use sonic.exe to generate the scripts that represent the changes.&nbsp; I could dump this script in the database project (or import it).<br><br>Right now it seems like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg">Rube-Goldbergian</a> mess.&nbsp; Any thoughts, ideas, suggestions?<br><p></p></p>
