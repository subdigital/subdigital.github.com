  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hadn&rsquo;t ever gotten around to replacing Notepad with the most-excellent <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html" target="_blank">Notepad2</a> until today and realized that the method outlined in <a href="http://www.flux88.com/ReplaceNotepadCompletely.aspx">my older post</a> <strong>doesn&rsquo;t</strong> <strong>work in Windows Vista</strong> due to heightened security.</p>


<p>To replace it on Vista, follow these steps:</p>


<ol><li>Download <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html" target="_blank">Notepad2</a> and put it in a folder somewhere like C:\tools\Notepad2</li><li>In Windows Explorer, navigate to C:\Windows\System32</li><li>Right-click on notepad.exe and go to Properties</li><li>Under the security tab, click Advanced.</li><li>Change the owner to MACHINE\Administrators</li><li>Close and re-open the properties box.</li><li>Go back to the security tab and click &ldquo;Edit&rdquo;</li><li>Give the Administrators group Full Control over the file.</li><li>Now go to a command prompt and type this:<br />copy c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe.old<br />copy c:\tools\notepad2\notepad2.exe c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe</li></ol>


<p>Voila!&nbsp; Now you should be back in business.</p>


<p>Now I&rsquo;m back to wondering why they didn&rsquo;t just make Notepad better in the first place&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Your manager comes to you and says &ldquo;Hey, Joe.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp; I&nbsp;need to get a new system developed to keep track of our help desk calls.&nbsp; It needs to have a slick user-interface that is easy to navigate, it needs to be fast, and also we need integration with SAP.&rdquo;&nbsp; You ponder what the system architecture might be like.&nbsp; He continues.&nbsp; &ldquo;So how long do you think this will take?&rdquo;</p>


<p>Of course, your first instinct is to <strong>tell your manager that you&rsquo;ll get back to him later with a rough estimate</strong>, but he is in a hurry and persistent.&nbsp; You cave in and tell him, &ldquo;I think it would take&nbsp;6 weeks.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Hrm, 6 weeks?&nbsp; I really need it in 5 weeks, no later.&rdquo;</p>


<p><em>Your manager is already negotiating your rough estimate.&nbsp; Be afraid.&nbsp; </em>You start to figure out how you can accomplish all of this in 5 weeks and you are realizing that you really needed <strong><em>eight</em></strong> weeks, not six.&nbsp; Let me put this story on pause while I tell you another story&hellip;</p>


<blockquote><p>Bob is the new night manager at FatBurger.&nbsp; One night a man walks in and requests a double Fat-burger with cheese, a large order of Fat Fries, and a chocolate shake.&nbsp; He pulls out the change in his pocket and Bob finds out that he only has $1.20.&nbsp; The entire meal costs $7.50.</p><p>What would you do in this situation?&nbsp; Turn away your only customer in the 11:00pm hour?&nbsp; Offer something that he <em>can</em> afford?&nbsp; Give it to him for $1.20&nbsp;<em>this time only?</em></p><p>Bob, being a proud night manager, wants to satisfy his customer.&nbsp; He cannot give away the food cheaply because then the guy will return again, expecting another discount.&nbsp; So Bob decides to get creative.&nbsp; He goes around back and finds a dead squirrel on the pavement.&nbsp; He scrapes it up with&nbsp;a shovel and brings it inside, grills it up and gives it to the man.</p></blockquote>


<p>In this story, Bob sacrified quality to give the gentleman what he wanted for only $1.20.</p>


<p>Stop me if this scenario sounds familiar.</p>


<p>Back at your desk, you are realizing that you are about to deliver to your manager a squirrel-burger.&nbsp; He wants X features, but you can&rsquo;t deliver them on time.&nbsp; The first thing you are going to throw out are automated tests.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ll stop refactoring.&nbsp; Pretty soon you are just heads-down coding like you did in high school and you are making a huge mess.</p>


<p>Two things are likely to happen.&nbsp; The system will buckle under its own weight because the code reaks of dead squirrels.&nbsp; The other thing that is likely to happen is that your system becomes useful, and now management has another request.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Hey Joe.&nbsp; The new system rocks!&nbsp; I just got off the phone with marketing and they want to start selling this to our larger clients.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Now you&rsquo;re in a pickle.&nbsp; You have a spaghetti-mess of a system and now you need to extend it and polish it for redistribution.&nbsp; </p>


<p>This sad state of affairs is all too common.&nbsp; Your manager might want a double Fat burger with cheese in 5&ndash;weeks, but what he&rsquo;s getting is a squirrel burger.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t deliver squirrel burgers.&nbsp; Be careful with off-the-cuff estimates that end up turning into negotiations.&nbsp; Joe should have negotiated features instead of quality to meet his 5&ndash;week deadline.&nbsp; Estimates should include time for automated tests and refactoring because it is part of your daily coding activity and it helps maintain quality.</p>


<p><em>I first heard the&nbsp;term &ldquo;squirrel burgers&rdquo; and the above story from Mark Pushinsky</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Agile Houston tonight was a pretty good turn out. There were over 30 people, so it was a good number to get people talking.&nbsp; If you came, I&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback in the comments!</p>


<p>I was able to talk to a number of agile folks from Houston and it&rsquo;s really cool to see this type of enthusiasm at a local level.</p>


<p>You can download the slides <a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/adopting-agile.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>


<p>(Matt recorded the whole thing, so if I can get the audio bits I&rsquo;ll post those as well).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Day 2 of the class went right into it and had a lot of good, hands-on excercises.&nbsp; Here are some notes from the day:</p>


<p><strong>Team</strong></p>


<ul><li>Includes everyone required to deliver the &ldquo;slice of the pie&rdquo;&nbsp; (the functionality for the sprint)</li><li>Extended teams are teams that you have to interface with to deliver your software.&nbsp; Peripheral teams may be doing waterfall and include vendor and/or teams external to the company.</li><li>The core team should all be co-located, and shouldn&rsquo;t be interrupted during a sprint</li><li>All teams go through the forming, storming, norming, and <strong>performing</strong>&nbsp;phase&hellip; even teams built with experienced scrum members.&nbsp; Team dynamics are always different.&nbsp; Mark (the trainer) wanted to stress that there is an additional phase here called &ldquo;Adjourning.&rdquo;&nbsp; This implies that you have to let go of your previous team if it&rsquo;s not bringing value.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t do things a certain way just because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s how we did it last time.&rdquo;</li><li>Good Scrum Coaches address problems by holding up a mirror rather than a stick.&nbsp; Get the team talking and let them come to a solution.&nbsp; Good coaches know how to set things up to get them talking and then shutup.</li><li>Recommended books:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Project-Retrospectives-Handbook-Team-Reviews/dp/0932633447/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-3491950-7742804?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1190593323&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Project Retrospectives</a> by Norman Kerth, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-3491950-7742804?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1190593277&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Agile Retrospectives</a> by Esther Derby, Diana Larsen, and Ken Schwaber.</li><li>Role of Managers often comes into question in Scrum.&nbsp; Are they pigs or chickens?</li><ul><li>Most of the time chickens</li><li>sometimes the product owner /&nbsp;customer, but depends on the project</li><li>Managers still have forsight of team impediments, so they can be very valuable.</li><li>Managers help the ScrumMaster remove impediments to the team</li></ul><li>Scrum scales via Scrum of Scrums</li><ul><li>1&ndash;2 Members from each team are part of Scrum of Scrums.&nbsp; Important to get the right people in the room (need problem solvers and cross-functional SMEs)</li><li>goal is to re-sync team efforts, share impediments (find common ones)</li><li>helpful to have someone of VP level present so that common impediments can be taken care of quickly</li><li>&ldquo;Distributed teams are hard.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; Scrum doesn&rsquo;t make them any easier.&rdquo;</li></ul><li>Distributed Teams</li><ul><li>NEVER as productive as co-located teams.</li><li>90% of communication is non-verbal so stand-ups over the phone are hard</li><li>Effective distributed teams START co-located, then distribute.</li><li>Spend the investment to bring people together or &ldquo;accept it and <strong>have bad teams</strong>.&rdquo;</li><li>The best distributed Scrum teams share a product backlog and task list (via tools or Spreadsheet) so that they still feel part of the same team.</li></ul><li>User stories</li><ul><li>Stories are not contracts.</li><li>Rather they are a placeholder for future conversation</li><li>Stories are not Requirements!&nbsp; Requirements are meant for defined system behavior for contractual purposes and not business-user friendly.&nbsp; User strories are meant so that business users understand them.</li><li><strong>INVEST</strong> in good user stories that are</li><ul><li>Independent</li><li>Negotiable</li><li>Valuable</li><li>Estimatable</li><li>Small</li><li>Testable</li></ul><li>Stories can be large at first (called Epics) then are broken down into (Themes), then finally into stories.&nbsp;Epics or themes never make it into the sprint, so break them down as soon as you can.</li><li>Purpose of stories:&nbsp; (3 C&rsquo;s)</li><ul><li>Card</li><li>Conversation</li><li>Confirmation</li></ul></ul><li>Estimating</li><ul><li>Use story points (or gummi bears&hellip; whatever) rather than hours.&nbsp; Hours decay.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want to have to re-estimate because your initial estimates were wrong.&nbsp; If you estimate that you can accomplish 24 story points and you only get 18, then you can only count on getting 18 the next sprint.&nbsp; If you estimate a task at 4 hours and it takes 8, then what about the other 4 hours tasks on the board?</li><li>Planning accuracy</li><ul><li>20% of the efforts gives you 80% of the benefit</li><li>Planning beyond that yields little return</li><li>&ldquo;Plans are useless. Planning is everything.&rdquo; &ndash; Eisenhower.</li></ul></ul></ul>


<p>The course was AWESOME and I strongly encourage others to take the course if you are interested in agile/scrum.</p>


<p>Afterwards we took Mark Pushinsky and Kert Peterson out to dinner and shared some stories and laughs.&nbsp; I hope to see these guys again in the future.<br /></p>


<p>(oh yeah, and Jimmy and I worked on something super secretive during our free time on this trip&hellip; more on that later on)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So my buddy Jimmy and I are in Austin right now taking a Certified ScrumMaster course by Mark Pushinksy.&nbsp; </p>


<p>I&rsquo;m ecstatic to be earning this certification, and while I won&rsquo;t be getting a &ldquo;Get out of my way, I&rsquo;m a ScrumMaster&rdquo; T-Shirt, I am getting incredibly valuable, practical Scrum training from two experts.</p>


<p>Excellent Quotes from today:</p>


<blockquote><p>Mark (trainer):&nbsp; So what do you see in the Waterfall model that you don&rsquo;t see in the agile model?<br />Guy: You mean &ldquo;Water<strong>fail</strong>&rdquo; ??</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mark (acting as a troubled PM who hasn&rsquo;t seen any results in 7 months):&nbsp; Well, I need ALL of those features.&nbsp; They are all important.<br />Jeff Palermo:&nbsp; What if I told you that your budget was reduced to 1/10th of what it is now.&nbsp; What would be&nbsp; most important then?<br />Mark:&nbsp; Umm, well all that is important.&nbsp; I need it ALL.<br />Jeff Palermo:&nbsp; Ok, so if I could give you <em>something </em>in 30 days, what would you like to see first?<br />Mark:&nbsp; You can give me something in 30 days?!?!?!</p><p><em>This dialog was very valuable to me.</em></p><p>Mark:&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t heal, what you can&rsquo;t feel.&nbsp; (not going to sell agile if they aren&rsquo;t already feeling pain with current process)</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p></blockquote>


<p>Here are some notable points:</p>


<ul><li>If you tell a customer that it&rsquo;s going to take 12&ndash;18 months to deliver his software, what kind of features do you think he&rsquo;s going to ask for?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going to think &ldquo;Well if I&rsquo;m not going to get it for over a year, I better get the everything and the kitchen sink!&rdquo;&nbsp; Contrast this with telling the customer that you can deliver in 30 days, what is most important?</li><li>Scrum demands transparency on the project.&nbsp; Why would some people resist this?&nbsp; Lack of trust, Fear of failure (or appearing as a failure).</li><li>Shu, Ha, Ri (martial arts terms &mdash; Learning the Rules, Applying the Rules, Adapting and Combining the Rules)</li><li>Waterfall separation of analyst, architects, developers, testers breeds lack of trust.&nbsp; In the extremem these groups become &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; &mdash; Ever heard &ldquo; Oh if we ever got good requirements we could deliver&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; or &ldquo;the developers are delivering tons of bugs to us!&nbsp; What are they doing?!?!&rdquo;</li><li>Agile/Iterative teams self-organize and fill needed roles to meet the sprint goal&nbsp;&ndash; this <em>fosters </em>trust between team members</li><li>The class had some trinkets and creativity toys which I thought was a nice touch to break the monotony of sitting in the same place for a long time</li><li>There were many hands on activities, many requiring us to stand up.&nbsp; These were awesome!</li><li>Think of scrum as a snowman.&nbsp; The head is the daily activity (24 hrs), the middle section is the sprint (2&ndash;4 weeks) and the base is the release plan (3&ndash;6 months)</li><li>Don&rsquo;t make squirrel burgers (don&rsquo;t deliver software that is low quality.&nbsp; Low quality means sloppy code, no unit tests, any corner-cutting.)</li></ul>


<p>Role of Scrum Master</p>


<ul><li>Remove barriers</li><li>Increase transparency</li><li>Help Customer/Product Owner realize ROI by prioritizing product backlog</li><li>Educating those involved about scrum rules</li><li>(Silent) leader / facilitator</li><li>Improving engineering practices to meeting shippable goal at end of sprint</li><li>empower team to&nbsp;make decisions and get stuff done (self organize)</li><li>look for &ldquo;coachable moments&rdquo;</li></ul>


<p>More to come tomorrow&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever gone to a site that you found via google that seems to have the EXACT answer to the problem you are looking for?&nbsp; Then you click on the link and you are shown a page that basically says &#8220;You must be a member to access this article.&#8221;<br><br>I can&#8217;t stand sites like this.&nbsp; In addition, they are in clear violation of Google&#8217;s TOS, and they should get dropped from indexing unless the open up the content.&nbsp; <br><br><i>Why are they in violation of Google&#8217;s TOS, you ask?</i>&nbsp; Well basically they are sniffing for googlebot (or any other web crawler) and serving up real content to them.&nbsp; The data gets indexed, the site&#8217;s PageRank goes up and the site starts showing high up in the google search results.&nbsp; But when you or I access the page, we get a different page, telling us that we should pay them money to see the content.<br><br>So if you want to give these sites a big middle finger, go download the <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/59">user agent switcher Firefox extension</a>.&nbsp; Then add the googlebot useragent to the list.&nbsp; You can get a huge list of commun useragents <a href="http://techpatterns.com/forums/about304.html">here</a>.<br><br>Now, find a site that blocks articles to non-members, such as this one:<br><br><img src="http://flux88.com/uploads/using-useragent-switcher1.png"><br><br>Change your user agent like so&#8230;.<br><br><img src="http://flux88.com/uploads/using-useragent-switcher2.png"><br><br>And refresh.&nbsp; <font size="-1">Voilà!</font> you&#8217;re in!<br><br><img src="http://flux88.com/uploads/using-useragent-switcher3.png"><br><p></p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am <a href="http://agilehouston.org/Main/AdoptingAgile" target="_blank">going to be speaking on Adopting Agile</a> to our local Agile Houston user group.&nbsp; Our last presenter, Robert Martin was excellent, and the speaker following me (who I shall not yet name for fear of jinxing it) is going to be stellar as well.&nbsp; <em>Maybe if I sandwich myself between great people I can be great by proxy.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see.</em></p>


<p>Anyway we&rsquo;re not yet sure of the venue (might not be at UH this time), so keep an eye out on the <a href="http://agilehouston.org/" target="_blank">agile houston website</a> for details.&nbsp; The date will either be September 24<sup>th</sup> or 25<sup>th</sup>, but I thought I would announce it now to give ample notice to those of you who are in Houston but don&rsquo;t subscribe to the <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=agilehouston.org_8usi44um97qqppr46b8g3383s4%40group.calendar.google.com" target="_blank">Agile Houston calendar</a>.</p>


<p>My talk will cover some of the foundational principles that are deemed &ldquo;agile&rdquo; and why they are valuable.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll also talk about the best way to go about introducing agile at a solo level, a team level, and a company level.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like it to go off as a sort of dialog to get everyone sharing experiences and opinions.</p>


<p>Come check it out next week!</p>
