<P>I hope everyone in Houston is safe, because it&#8217;s going to be incredibly difficult to get out of the city now.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad we left when we did.</P>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My mom died last Wednesday, due to advanced ovarian cancer. She was 53. It has been quite a sad household for the past week and a half, and I don&#8217;t expect it to get better anytime soon. I will really miss her. </p>


<p>Her funeral was on Saturday and the service was beautiful. Many people were present and I knew most of them. </p>


<p>My mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2001 and fought it for more than 3 years before deciding to choose quality of life over longevity. Cancer is an ugly thing. I&#8217;m glad she did get a lot of good moments and memories in the past year and a half that we&#8217;ve been taking care of her. </p>


<p>Anyway, consider making a small donation to the <a href="http://www.ocrf.org/site/c.kwK0JbNTJtF/b.574943/k.CBC0/Home.htm" target="_blank">Ovarian Cancer Research Fund</a>. </p>


<p>During this tragedy I didn&#8217;t get out much, and had no idea about Hurricane Katrina until yesterday. The Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund is in need of cash donations, and I&#8217;m glad the Buzz stepped up. They are going to try and hit $500k by the end of the day. I really respect what they are doing.&nbsp; What a sad month it has been&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have heard so many discussions (read: arguments) about which DAL method is the best and nobody ever has a clear-cut case for all solutions.&nbsp; Previously I have sort of&nbsp; &ldquo;rolled my own&rdquo; data layer, with a simple helper class and some parametrized queries.&nbsp; This has slowly grown into a very lite version of the Data Access Application Block from Microsoft (which kinda makes me grin, b/c that wasn&rsquo;t the intent).</p>


<p>The last project I started used NHibernate.&nbsp; It really did make a lot of things easy, and definitely sped up development.&nbsp; I was a little weary of the learning curve (which only gets steeper the more complex your schema gets), but I eventually came up with a solid solution that has held up well.&nbsp; I did have to make certain design considerations using NHibernate, which I didn&rsquo;t like, but I got over it.</p>


<p>Anyway, I get to start fresh on a new project again and I&rsquo;m back at the same step:&nbsp; how should I shape my data layer?&nbsp; Should I use NHibernate again?&nbsp; Should I use CSLA.NET?</p>


<p>Here&rsquo;s what I am considering:</p>


<ul><li>My own hand-made DAL.</li><li>CSLA.NET</li><li>Use Enterprise Library (specifically the Data Access Application Block)</li><li>NHibernate </li></ul>


<p>Right now I&rsquo;m leaning toward CSLA, because I think it might integrate quite nicely with a large project we currently have, where the DAL it uses (well, only about 25% of the code even uses the middle tier) is sort of primitive. (anyway, don&rsquo;t get me started on this, it&rsquo;s a mess that needs to be cleaned up)</p>


<p>My goal is to provide a boilerplate DAL that ALL of our upcoming projects can utilize effectively (large or small).&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been playing MOH: European Assault for XBox lately, and I think it is a pretty solid WW2 shooter.&nbsp; The controller gun action is pretty easy to get used to (I&rsquo;m so used to a mouse it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to play on a console).&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what is is that attracts me to WW2 shooters over others like Viet Nam or futuristic ones.&nbsp; Maybe it&rsquo;s the terrain, maybe it&rsquo;s the time period, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m addicted and I play just about every single one that comes out.</p>


<p>One thing is bugging me though.&nbsp; Why is it that in just about EVERY World War 2 game I&rsquo;ve ever played snipers pop out of windows on the 2nd or 3rd floor, you shoot them, and they fall <strong>forward</strong> out of the window.&nbsp; For a genre of games that are supposed to be incredibly realistic, that just seems stupid.&nbsp; In 1944 did bullets actually pull people toward the shooter?&nbsp; Not only is this dumb because it happens, but also because it happens to <strong>ANYONE </strong>who is standing near a ledge.&nbsp; I know for a fact if I shoot this guy on the water tower that he&rsquo;s going to fall over the railing.</p>


<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of what I&rsquo;m talking about:</p>


<p><img height="300" alt="Moh_falloutofwindow" src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/moh_falloutofwindow_small.jpg" width="400" align="textTop" border="0" /></p>


<p>Of all of the WW2 shooters out so far, here are my favorites:</p>


<p><strong>Brothers in Arms</strong> &ndash; I love the realistic team play.&nbsp; I rarely play a game like this twice, but this one was an exception.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t wait for BIA 2.</p>


<p><strong>Call of Duty</strong> (and expansion) &ndash; This game was so cinematic, it really kicked MOH out of my favorite spot for a while.&nbsp; I keep playing this one, simply because it&rsquo;s so immersive.</p>


<p><strong>Battlefield 1942</strong> &ndash; I played this game for hours on end.&nbsp; The sniper rifle was more realistic than you usually find in games (some people probably found it annoying, but I found it challenging).&nbsp; I got pretty good at hitting running enemies from 300 yards away, leading the crosshairs in front of their heads by about 2 inches.&nbsp; Yummy.</p>


<p><strong>MOH Frontline</strong> &ndash; I feel that this game really set the stage.&nbsp; It had a great soundtrack and really felt like Saving Private Ryan.&nbsp; The other Medal of Honors didn&rsquo;t quite capture the atmosphere like this one, but they were fun to play nonetheless.</p>

<p>It is now Sunday afternoon and I am about 200 pages into it.&nbsp; I am really enjoying his attention to detail on topics that are often ignored in most online resources and even&nbsp;other game programming books!</p>


<p>This book really DOES belong on your bookshelf if you enjoy game programming at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I wanted to extend my NHibernate implementation to allow formulti-page transactions for certain operations (that I control) andkeep with the cleaner ISession-per-HttpRequest pattern for everythingelse.</p>


<p>To do that I had to modify my HttpModule to allow for this check,but I had no access to the SessionState here.&nbsp; Why is that?</p>


<p>Here’s what I was doing in my HttpModule:</p>


<p></p>


<div id="code">
<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>public void Init(HttpApplication application)&lt;br>&lt;br>{ &lt;br> &lt;span class="comments">//add event handlers&lt;br>&lt;/span>&nbsp;application.BeginRequest += new EventHandler(context_BeginRequest);&lt;br>&nbsp;application.EndRequest += new EventHandler(context_EndRequest); &lt;br>}</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>
</div>


<p></p>


<p>I was creating and disconnecting my ISession object inside of thosemethods. The problem is that SessionState is not loaded until after theBeginRequest had fired and before the EndRequest had fired.(specifically it is accessibly after the AcquireRequestState event).So, changing my code to this worked:<br><br></p>


<div id="code">
<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>public void Init(HttpApplication application) &lt;br>{ &lt;br>application.PreRequestHandlerExecute += new EventHandler(application_PreRequestHandlerExecute); &lt;br>application.PostRequestHandlerExecute += new EventHandler(application_PostRequestHandlerExecute); &lt;br>}</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>
</div>


<p></p>


<p>Also, I saw some people online incorrectly suggesting that oneimplement the IRequiresSessionState or IReadOnlySessionStateinterfaces, but if you read the docs, those are marker interfaces forHttpHandlers only. </p>
