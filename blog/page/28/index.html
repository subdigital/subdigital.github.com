<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I first tried to install it without Visual Studio 2003.&nbsp; It complained, so I got Visual Studio Installed.&nbsp; It also asked for the IE Web Controls, so I downloaded those, extracted it, and ran the build.bat file.&nbsp; I copied the sample app as directed and everything was working there.</span></font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I didn&rsquo;t have SQL Server installed locally, so I didn&rsquo;t have SQL-DMO, but the installer didn&rsquo;t tell me how to get it.&nbsp; It kept complaining that I didn&rsquo;t have Visual Studio 2002, Visual Studio 2003, IE Web Controls, and SQL-DMO, when I clearly had 2 of those 4.</span></font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></font></p>


<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I installed the SQL Client tools and that solved the SQL-DMO requirement.&nbsp; Then I found an MSI installer for IE Web Controls, and that did the trick there (apparently it doesn&rsquo;t REALLY check to see if you have it, it just checks the Add/Remove Programs section).&nbsp; Visual Studio 2002 isn&rsquo;t really required, the wording is just off on the installer.</span></font></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I gave a talk on Continuous Integration last night at the Houston Sark Office.&nbsp; Thanks to all who attended.</p>


<p>We had pizza and discussed some of the processes and principles behind CI, as well as some of the tools to get you there.&nbsp; I did a live demo of an app, connected to source control and a build server. </p>


<p>A-la <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2005/11/07/134400.aspx" target="_blank">Jeremy Miller</a>, I had my CCTray audio clips setup, so when the build failed, you&rsquo;d hear Napolean Dynamite say &ldquo;Freakin Idiot!&rdquo;</p>


<p>I think it went well, however for those of you who attended, I&rsquo;d really like to hear your thoughts!&nbsp; Please take a second to leave a comment.</p>


<p>Here are the files used in the demo:</p>


<p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/continuous_20integration.zip">continuous integration.zip (8323 KB)</a></p>


<p>(included are the sample project, cruise control config, and power-point slides)</p>


<p><em>I left out the build server installation because it was over 70mb.&nbsp; It consisted of Subversion binaries, Nant, and a Cruise folder with some project state data.</em></p>


<p>I got amazing help from <a href="http://jpboodhoo.com/blog" target="_blank">Jean-Paul Boodhoo</a>, who has a <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/NAntStarterSeries.aspx" target="_blank">9 part NAnt starter series</a>, which ends on a screencast of setting up CruiseControl!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my search for the <em>one-command automated build</em>, I&rsquo;ve often stumbled upon how to deal with the database while writing code on a multi-developer project.</p>


<p>Most of us use source control, however only a small fraction of us actually store the database scripts in source control.&nbsp; This is a powerful tool that is often missed completely.</p>


<p>This is a development process I see frequently:</p>


<ul><li>get the latest version of the source from VSS</li><li>exclusively check-out the code files you need</li><li>make changes to the code and the database to enable your new features</li><li>check in the code once it is all done</li><li>do a sql compare to the dev/test databases to get a delta script</li><li>run the compare script in the test environment and deploy the project to test.</li></ul>


<p>There are a number flaws in this process, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop people from continuing along this path for an entire project.&nbsp; Rather than point out everything that scares me from that list, I&rsquo;ll focus on the database portion. </p>


<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with just making changes and then doing a SQL compare?&nbsp; Well, for starters&hellip; that compare script is used once and thrown away.&nbsp; It is never checked into source control.&nbsp; If we need to restore the state of an application as of 4 months ago, we can do it with the code, but not the database.&nbsp; The database only stays on the current version, and there&rsquo;s no going back.&nbsp; Another drawback is that the process is a manual one, and we want to get into automation.&nbsp; Lastly, SQL Compare (and SQL Delta) are both licensed tools, and not all of us can purchase them.&nbsp; At home I cannot justify the cost, so I am forced to come up with something else.</p>


<p>The Ruby on Rails community is lucky.&nbsp; Baked into the Rails framework is something called <em>migrations</em>.</p>


<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re on a ruby project for managing houses for sale.&nbsp; You get a new feature request where you want to know how many bathrooms a house has (strange request, huh?).&nbsp; You make the changes to model (adding a <em>bathrooms </em>property) but now you need the database to support it.&nbsp; So you type <em>rails script/generate migration Add_House_Bathrooms</em>.&nbsp; This will generate a ruby code file in the <strong>/</strong><em>project/db/migrations/xxx_Add_House_Bathrooms.rb </em>file.&nbsp; (the xxx will be replaced with sequential ordering, so rails knows what order to execute the migrations)&nbsp;Inside this file are 2 methods:&nbsp; <strong>up</strong> and <strong>down</strong>.&nbsp; This is, <em>how to I create the changes</em>, and <em>how do I remove the changes</em>.&nbsp; Inside these methods you can write code that adds and removes the column you want.</p>


<p>So then when you need to deploy, rails knows what version the database is on (by having a version table), and can apply the migrations since that version to bring the database up to speed with the code.&nbsp; If something goes wrong, it can roll the changes back to the original version (by using the <em>down</em> methods).</p>


<p>You can even create migrations that load dummy test data, or default values for static lookup tables.</p>


<p>It usually only takes a little while for a cool idea to make its way into the .NET world, and migrations are no exception.&nbsp; The Castle Project is a collection of many RoR-esque utilities packaged into one.&nbsp; One of those utilities is called Migrator, which lives in the Generator project.</p>


<p>To generate a migration, you type:</p>


<p><strong><em>generate migration Add_House_Bathrooms</em></strong></p>


<p>With this, you can enable this style of migration in .NET.&nbsp; You create migrations, these end up as C# code files in your db/migrations folder.&nbsp; The same concept applies.</p>


<p>The migrator is fairly young, but it was extracted from CastleContrib into the main Castle trunk, so that is a good sign that it is here to stay and will have active support.</p>


<p>When I have more time to play with this, I&rsquo;ll try and post a little demo.&nbsp; For now, check out the castle project at <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/">http://www.castleproject.org</a></p>


<p>What does your team do to manage database changes and enable versioning?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My latest assignment at work was somewhat small, and the requirements were fairly straightforward so I got to work immediately.&nbsp; My early requests to meet with my user were met with &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get a demo first.&rdquo;&nbsp; Given the availability of all parties involved, this took longer than I would have liked.</p>


<p>So here I am, 60 work-hours later, I have a fully functional, ready-to-deploy application, and I have yet to meet with my user.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s sincerely hope he doesn&rsquo;t decide that this isn&rsquo;t what he wanted in the first place.</p>


<p>Then my office-mate recognized our new development process.&nbsp; Ladies and gentlement, I give you <strong>Eliga!</strong>&nbsp; </p>


<p>Eliga is the opposite of agile.&nbsp; Here is our manifesto: </p>


<p><em>Forget users, they will only slow me down!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t disturb me when I&rsquo;m coding you peons!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hear your impressions when I&rsquo;m finished!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be bothered with workflow changes!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re already coded and set in stone!</em></p>

<ul><li>I was born on a farm in Oregon.&nbsp; I still remember my favorite cow (Jesse) from our farm.&nbsp; One day he was gone.&nbsp; Where did he go?</li><li>I used to be insane on rollerblades.&nbsp; My friends and I would jump pretty much anything.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s actually amazing that I didn&rsquo;t break any bones jumping over staircases and stuff, especially since I am so accident prone.</li><li>I got my first guitar when I was 7, however I didn&rsquo;t really pick up playing until 12 or so.&nbsp; I still play, but not as often as I would like to.</li><li>I first got into computer programming watching my dad write a hangman game from scratch.&nbsp; I picked up QBASIC when I was 13 or 14, and I would write little screen savers using the primitive graphics drawing routines it had.&nbsp; My pinnacle QBASIC program was a hoax that my friend and I pulled on his younger brother.&nbsp; We called it &ldquo;DelBug&rdquo; and it was supposed to remove bugs from programs, such as Doom 2, which just-so-happened to be causing him troubles.&nbsp; It went through a series of fake menus and ended up pretending to format his hard drive.&nbsp; It was great!&nbsp; He almost wet himself when it started flashing and rebooting in a loop.</li><li>And lastly, I just got married!&nbsp; (Pictures coming soon).&nbsp; Silvia and I had a beautiful ceremony and lots of close friends and family were present.</li></ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/zune_2Dblack_.jpg" hspace="4"  border="0"  />I received a black Zune for Christmas, despite it&rsquo;s lackluster sales and reviews by some.</p>


<p>I resisted getting an iPod for the longest time, because I wouldn&rsquo;t buy into the hype.</p>


<p>I compared a number of features to decide between a Zune and an 30gb iPod Video.</p>


<p><strong>Screen Size &ndash; </strong>The Zune has a very large screen compared to the iPod.&nbsp; For video you turn it sideways for a widescreen view, and it makes watching movies very do-able.</p>


<p><strong>Interface</strong> &ndash; Call me crazy, but I&rsquo;m not too fond of the iPod interface.&nbsp; When I used the iPod Video at the Apple Store, I was immediately annoyed that it asked me <em>every time</em> if I wanted TV on or TV off when I clicked on a video.&nbsp; The TV wasn&rsquo;t even connected!&nbsp; For a company so anal about usability, making the users make a redundant and unnecessary choice before showing videos is a no-no.&nbsp; The interface for the Zune is easy to use and the buttons make sense.&nbsp; The iPod isn&rsquo;t <em>bad<strong>, </strong></em>I just don&rsquo;t care for it very much.</p>


<p><strong>Wireless</strong> &ndash; I originally thought this was one of the coolest features of the Zune.&nbsp; It uses standard WiFi to transfer data between 2 Zunes, however it doesn&rsquo;t connect to my wireless network at home, which is a disappointment.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know anybody that has a Zune, so I haven&rsquo;t yet tried out the Social aspect of it.&nbsp; There are hacks that allow you to transfer a file unlimited times between Zunes wirelessly, but it involves registry hacks on the host computer, and renaming the file as an image.&nbsp; That makes it pretty much useless because I have a usb thumb drive in my pocket that can do the same thing easier.</p>


<p><strong>Podcasts </strong>&ndash; I&rsquo;ve become addicted to a number of podcasts, some with video, so I wanted good podcast support.&nbsp; I was disappointed to find that the Zune has almost NO notion of podcasts.&nbsp; Sure I can point the Zune software (which sucks, more on that later) to a folder where I download podcasts, but they don&rsquo;t live in a separate section on the Zune.&nbsp; I hope Microsoft fixes this in a future firmware update.&nbsp; iPod / iTunes wins on this hands-down.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m currently using uTorrent for BT feeds, and Doppler for video/audio feeds.&nbsp; These go into my <em>podcasts</em> folder which gets picked up by the Zune software.&nbsp; The video has to be re-encoded to the Zune format, which is annoying.&nbsp; I would think that WMV would be playable out of the box.</p>


<p><strong>Video</strong> &ndash; I originally dismissed Video as excessive in a portable player, but now it&rsquo;s my favorite feature.&nbsp; I have a lot of downloaded tv shows, and I plan on putting them on the Zune to watch while I work out.&nbsp; I ride an exercise bike to strengthen my leg and I can easily watch a TV show in that time.&nbsp; The problem I see now, however, is that my shows are in Divx or Xvid format, which I have to re-encode using <a title="Any Video Converter" href="http://www.any-dvd-converter.com/" target="_blank">Any Video Converter</a>&nbsp;to AVI or MPEG, then it has to be encoded <em>again</em> in the Zune format.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m hoping this process gets easier, or that the Zune will support Divx in the future.&nbsp; One thing that would be nice is if I could encode video <em>before I&rsquo;m ready to sync.</em>&nbsp; I find it annoying that I have to surrender my Zune for at least 30 minutes if I need to transfer a couple <a title="diggnation" href="http://diggnation.com/" target="_blank">diggnation</a> episodes.</p>


<p><strong>Music</strong> &ndash; This is a no-brainer for most MP3 players.&nbsp; Both the iPod and Zune have excellent usage in terms of usability.&nbsp; I like the large album art that is displayed during playback on the Zune, though I hear the new iPods do this as well.</p>


<p><strong>Size</strong> &ndash; The iPod wins in this category.&nbsp; The Zune is about 1/2&rdquo; thick, which is quite large.&nbsp; The iPod is about 1/4&rdquo; thick, so it&rsquo;s twice as thin.&nbsp; I decided that the other features were worth the trade-off in Size.</p>


<p><strong>PC Software &ndash; </strong>The Zune software sucks.&nbsp; Big time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminds me a lot of iTunes, but it doesn&rsquo;t really deliver.&nbsp; I ignore the Marketplace, so for me it&rsquo;s just a mechanism to transfer files over.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to use MediaMonkey, but it&rsquo;s not supported yet.&nbsp; I found a few mistagged files while listening to music on the Zune, so I <strong>flagged</strong> them.&nbsp; They showed up in my Zune &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; the next time I sync&rsquo;ed.&nbsp; From there it shows me the file, but it doesn&rsquo;t let me edit the tags!&nbsp; How stupid is that?&nbsp; The only option I have is to delete the file and look at Properties, which is useless to me.&nbsp; </p>


<p>The Zune software also has zero support for subscribing to podcasts, let along distinguishing my podcasts between regular music aside from Genre.</p>


<p><strong>Audiobooks &ndash; </strong>I haven&rsquo;t yet tried listening to an Audiobook, however I plan on it.&nbsp; I listed to the Da Vinci code about 8 months ago and I loved it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m hoping that it will be easy to listen to Audiobooks.</p>


<p>All in all, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with an iPod or a Zune.&nbsp; Both are fantastic devices, and I am very happy with my Zune.&nbsp; I hope for a few improvements via firmware soon, but it&rsquo;s a new device and I think Microsoft will catch on soon.</p>


<p>Now, the question is&hellip; do I attempt the <a title="iPod mods 80gb zune upgrade" href="http://www.ipodmods.com/shop/zune-repair-guides.html" target="_blank">80gb mod</a>?</p>
