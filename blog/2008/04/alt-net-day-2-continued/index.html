<div class="entry-content"><p><em>I&rsquo;m sitting here at SeaTac Airport and really soaking in all of the events from the weekend.&nbsp; Here is&nbsp;the finished recap of day 2&hellip;</em></p>


<p>Lunch was next, and Microsoft provided some really good sandwiches.&nbsp; </p>


<p><img src="/images/lunch_.jpg" alt="Lunch"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Lots of conversation continued&hellip;&nbsp; I think these guys are talking about how to leverage SharePoint in all software development efforts.&nbsp; Or maybe not <img src="/images/smile1__________________________________.gif"   /></p>


<p><img src="/images/conversations3_.jpg" alt="Conversations3"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Some people took this time to do a little work&hellip;</p>


<p><img src="/images/orenhardatwork_.jpg" alt="Orenhardatwork"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>In this time Oren probably rewrote SVNBridge or something.&nbsp; You know, about 30 minutes of work.</p>


<p>Here&rsquo;s Phatboyg:</p>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0217_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0217"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>and good &lsquo;ole JP Boodhoo is always fun to chat with:</p>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0218_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0218"  border="0"  /></p>


<p><a href="http://www.codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palermo</a> was working on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuCGaBxjJhI" target="_blank">a Youtube video of the participants</a>.&nbsp; Somehow I was edited out of his video.&nbsp; Intentionally?&nbsp; I think so.</p>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0222_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0222"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>I mean come on, just look at that evil smile!</p>


<p><strong>Talking to Suits</strong></p>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0223_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0223"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>After lunch I went to &ldquo;Talking to Suits&rdquo; which was a&nbsp;pretty good discussion, however there was a lot of noice chat in my opinion.&nbsp; I got the most value out of listening to <a href="http://udidahan.weblogs.us/" target="_blank">Udi Dahan</a>, <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/" target="_blank">Chad Myers</a>, and <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/" target="_blank">Jim (effin) Shore</a> (!).</p>


<p><em>Notes from the session:</em></p>


<ul><li>Problems:</li><ul><li>Fear</li><ul><li>lack of stuff (documentation, etc)</li><li>no <u>trust</u></li></ul></ul><li>Some people suggested the subversive approach to agile.</li><ul><li>can work for TDD, CI, etc. but those things are more about quality.&nbsp; Your manager won&rsquo;t care how you do things if you present it to them in their terms (ie: code quality, better maintainability, less bugs found in production, etc)</li><li>you can&rsquo;t sneak in <u>trust</u> though</li></ul><li>Need to exhibit empathy, respect and understanding</li><li>Convey the <u>value</u> in terms of the &ldquo;suit&rdquo;&nbsp; </li><li>&ldquo;Suit&rdquo; was chosen deliberately to convey perception (back to respect &amp; empathy)</li><li>The &ldquo;suits&rdquo; are not opponents</li><li>Good book:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rules-Radicals-Saul-Alinsky/dp/0679721134" target="_blank">Rules for Radicals</a></li></ul>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0224_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0224"  border="0"  /></p>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0225_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0225"  border="0"  /></p>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0226_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0226"  border="0"  /></p>


<p><strong>Behavior Driven Development</strong></p>


<p>The next session was a tough choice.&nbsp; I started out in the BDD session.&nbsp; Unfortunately Scott Bellware had some computer hiccups (I think Windows sabotaged him) &mdash; anyway he lost about 10 solid minutes just on setup.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Points were:</p>


<ul><li>TDD tests don&rsquo;t prove any business reason why the test even exists in the first place.&nbsp; With BDD, your tests are <strong>directly</strong> tied to a feature, so you are less likely to start building features that are not even needed.&nbsp; TDD can&rsquo;t protect you from that.</li><li>To Estimate user stories you <strong>must </strong>have some acceptance criteria for the story.&nbsp; That can be technical or non-technical / functional or non-functional.&nbsp; This drives your BDD Tests, or &ldquo;specs.&rdquo;</li><li>It&rsquo;s ok to have very technical acceptance criteria like &ldquo;An order table must&nbsp;be created to store the orders&rdquo; &mdash; Stories are not a customer artifact, they are a team artifact.</li></ul>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0228_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0228"  border="0"  /></p>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0229_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0229"  border="0"  /></p>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0230_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0230"  border="0"  /></p>


<p><em>Yes that guy *is* wearing a utili-kilt.&nbsp; He does that.</em></p>


<p>The material that I saw was pretty much the same as what I&rsquo;ve seen before, so I decided to duck out and check out the NHibernate for Deadheads talk.</p>


<p><strong>NHibernate for Deadheads (or with Cartoon Bears)</strong></p>


<p>To my extreme disappointment there were no cartoon bears in this session, but it was a pretty good Q &amp; A about what NHibernate is good at and why people should not cling to traditional stored procedure + datasets method of data access.&nbsp; I was able to contribute to this session, so that felt good.</p>


<p>After <a href="http://www.ayende.com/blog" target="_blank">Oren</a> and I went back &amp; forth for about 30 minutes about effective use of NHibernate he finally came up to me and noticed my nametag.&nbsp; It looked like this:</p>


<blockquote>Ben Scheirman <br />@subdigital <br />http://flux88.com </blockquote>


<p>He finally put it together, as we have talked a bunch of times online, but he hadn&rsquo;t put my name to my face to my blog, etc.&nbsp; It was pretty comical.&nbsp; Next time we should have everyone do nametags.</p>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0231_small1_.jpg" alt="IMG_0231"  border="0"  /></p>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0233_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0233"  border="0"  /></p>


<p><em>Notes from the session:</em></p>


<ul><li>What about sprocs?</li><ul><li>sprocs offer no perf benefits over properly executed dynamic sql, which nhibernate does.</li></ul><li>What about the generated SQL?</li><ul><li>most of the time it is quite good.&nbsp; NHibernate is better at it than I am in a lot of cases.</li><li>The cases where you find that there is a specific query that you want to use and NHibernate chooses to do it a different way, you can provide these as named queries to NHibernate.&nbsp; <strong>Use SQL Profiler</strong> <strong>and be aware what&rsquo;s going on w/ your database.</strong></li></ul><li>NHibernate complexity</li><ul><li>too steep a learning curve for new folks</li><li>once you &ldquo;grok&rdquo; it you can be incredibly productive.</li><ul><li>the data access becomes a solved problem</li></ul><li>irresponsible development leads to serious N+1 select problems.&nbsp; Need to first identify where that happens then find out how to fix it.</li><ul><li>to identify:&nbsp; can use Ayende&rsquo;s PagePerformanceModule and limit the # of queries at a per page basis.&nbsp; This is very quick feedback.</li><li>to fix:&nbsp; understand lazy loading and eager fetching.</li></ul><li>object design can affect this</li><ul><li>deep inheritance hierarchies (while generally painful in OO) pose big problems depending on the strategy you use</li><ul><li>table per subclass: lots of joins &amp; extra queries to get the data for 1 entity</li><li>table per concrete class: lots of duplication</li><li>table per hierarchy: flattened table with all columns for all derived classes.&nbsp; Limits queries needed, but then you have strange db semantics and no clear way of putting not-null constraints on some columns.&nbsp; Perf problems with lots of columns as well.</li></ul></ul><li>lots of people have seen NHibernate used poorly&hellip; including me</li><ul><li>how to fix this?</li><li>NHibernate gets a bad rep</li><li>unfortunately we didn&rsquo;t dig deep en
ough here.</li></ul></ul></ul>


<p>Some people expressed concern with NHibernate XML mapping (learning, understanding deep concepts) &ndash;&ndash; Chris Ortman and Oren both mentioned using ActiveRecord attributes to manage this.&nbsp; I interpreted this as saying Use ActiveRecord (as in, inherit your entities from ActiveRecordBase&lt;T&gt;, which is something that I don&rsquo;t really like to do).&nbsp; Chris later suggested that I look at RhinoCommons to see how Ayende does Repository&lt;T&gt; with classes that have ActiveRecord attributes.&nbsp; They are not quite POCO&rsquo;s, but at least the class doesn&rsquo;t inherit from a persistence aware base class.&nbsp; I will definitely be looking into this.&nbsp; (<em>Damnit, when will planes have wireless internet for us?!?!)</em></p>


<p><em><strong>Double Double &ldquo;D&rdquo; (or Distributed Domain Driven Design)</strong></em></p>


<p>I wanted to go to this session in hopes of getting some more structure around what Greg Young was actually talking about.&nbsp; Right now I&rsquo;m not really feeling the pain of what he&rsquo;s talking about so I think the talk was a little over my head.&nbsp; Some good take aways:</p>


<ul><li>&ldquo;How many of you have an EmailGatewaySerivce in your domain?&rdquo;</li><ul><li>about 15 people raise their hand</li></ul><li>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a noun.&nbsp; But does it belong in the ubiquitous language?&nbsp; Do you talk to your business experts about this EmailGatewayService?&rdquo;</li><li>convert it to a verb.</li><ul><li>Create a new SendEmailMessage, pass it to a message handler</li></ul><li>DDDD can help you scale to extreme levels by decoupling your domain from itself.&nbsp; (ie: internal messaging, not just over service boundaries).</li></ul>


<p><img src="/images/IMG_0238_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0238"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>About this time I saw a tweet by Matt Hinze that the Pair Programming session was pretty cool so I snuck out and went to check that out&hellip;</p>


<p><strong>Pair Programming (Ping Pong Style)</strong></p>


<p>Chad Myers and Ray Houston paired up for this one to demonstrate how to use the ping-pong-pairing technique &amp; TDD to build out a flash card system.</p>


<p>Ping-poing paring goes like this:</p>


<ol><li>I write a test.&nbsp; I make it compile.&nbsp; I run the test.&nbsp; It fails.&nbsp; I slide the keyboard to you.</li><li>You implement the bare minimum code to get the test to pass.&nbsp; Make sure you don&rsquo;t add gold plating or nice-to-have things here.&nbsp; Once the test passes, refactor to remove duplication and code smells.&nbsp; Now you write a failing test.&nbsp; Make it compile.&nbsp; Slide the keyboard to me.</li><li>I implement the features, following the same steps as #2.</li><li>Repeat until feature is done.</li></ol>


<p>In this sense there is a good rhythm to pairs.&nbsp; Each person has a specific set of things to do, and the person watching can help them avoid pitfalls or shortcuts and generally keep everyone honest.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like continuous code reviews.</p>


<p>I think a lot of people got some good info on TDD and RhinoMocks from this as well.&nbsp; Ray Houston is a BDD Practitioner, so I noted his style of naming test classes &amp; methods.&nbsp; I may start doing this very soon, as BDD is just making more and more sense.</p>


<p>Chad and I did a screencast doing this same thing last week but CamStudio decided to crash while encoding the video and we lost the whole thing.&nbsp; Some folks expressed interest in us doing this again.&nbsp; I wish Camtasia had a community or personal license that was cheap.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s such a good tool.</p>


<p><strong>Wrap up &amp; Dinner at Mehfil&rsquo;s Fine Indian Restaurant</strong></p>


<p>We wrapped up the day with Doc admiring the amazing thing that is Open Spaces.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so interesting to watch a group self organize and see awesome results emerge.</p>


<p>I could tell that most people were mostly drained.&nbsp; It takes a lot of mental energy to engage at a high level like that the entire day.&nbsp; Add to that the fact that probably half of the attendees were also at the MVP Summit last week.&nbsp; What I&rsquo;ve found after both ALT.NET conferences is that I need a couple of days to really let everything process and to make some goals about how I want to take that knowledge and energy to go do something good.</p>


<p>A good bunch of us went to Mehfil&rsquo;s (an Indian Restaurant).&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat at a table with <a href="http://www.caffeinatedcoder.com/" target="_blank">Russell Ball</a>&nbsp;(Caffeinated Coder)and <a href="http://www.codebetter.com/blogs/ian_cooper" target="_blank">Ian Cooper</a>.&nbsp; Most of our conversation was around world politics and history, which was quite interesting.</p>


<p>I went to the bar for a few drinks and to talk to <a href="http://www.stevenharman.net/" target="_blank">Steve Harman</a> about some SubSonic thoughts.&nbsp; I was pretty beat, so I went up to my hotel to crash.</p>


<p>Stay tuned for my recap on Day 3&hellip;</p>
